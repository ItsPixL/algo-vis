# AlgoVis

AlgoVis is an interactive web application built using React.js that visually demonstrates how various computer science algorithms work in real time. Designed to aid learning and understanding, this tool provides animated, step-by-step visualisations of popular algorithms in sorting, searching, graph traversal, and pathfinding. AlgoVis emphasises clean UI/UX, modular React components, and real-time DOM manipulation to deliver intuitive and informative algorithm animations.
